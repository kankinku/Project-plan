# Core Principles & Anti-Patterns

## The 10 Commandments (Based on Dieter Rams)
*Only assets that pass this filter are considered "Core Investments".*

1.  **Is Innovative**: Does it define the future? (e.g., Apple, Tesla in their prime)
2.  **Makes a Product Useful**: Does it solve a real human problem?
3.  **Is Aesthetic**: Is the business model beautiful? Are the margins and efficiency high?
4.  **Makes a Product Understandable**: Is the revenue structure transparent and simple?
5.  **Is Honest**: Does the management tell the truth, even when it hurts?
6.  **Is Unobtrusive**: Does it avoid unnecessary hype and noise?
7.  **Is Long-lasting**: Will it exist 10 years from now?
8.  **Is Thorough Down to the Last Detail**: Is the execution flawless?
9.  **Is Environmentally Friendly**: Is it sustainable (ESG)?
10. **Is Less, But Better**: Does it strip away the non-essential?

## The 3 Pillars of Survival
1.  **The Safety Net (50% Cash)**
    - *Definition*: 50% of Total Assets held in KRW/USD or Short-term Gov Bonds.
    - *Purpose*: Mental stability and dry powder for crises (3rd Low Points).
2.  **The Mirror (Self-Reflection)**
    - *Rule*: Never invest beyond your competence. If you don't know who "the sucker" at the table is, it's you.
3.  **The Shield (Defensive Mindset)**
    - *Rule*: Earning is optional; surviving is mandatory.

## Anti-Patterns (What We DO NOT Do)
The agent must proactively reject these behaviors:

*   **Chasing The Pump**: Buying because a green candle is getting longer.
*   **Revenge Trading**: Increasing size to recover losses immediately.
*   **Guru Following**: Buying just because a famous investor did.
*   **Predicting The Top**: Selling everything because "it feels too high" (without signal).
*   **Ignoring The Fed**: Fighting the central bank's liquidity tides.
*   **Over-Leveraging**: Using x3 leveraged ETFs (TQQQ/SOXL) without a defined "Season 3" skill set.
